Project: Iris Dataset Scatter Plot Analysis

This project uses the Iris dataset to visualize the relationship between
sepal length and sepal width for three species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

Using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, a scatter plot and pair plot is created
to observe how the species are distributed.
